# KNN
K Nearest Neighbour

## Problem Description
The iris data set is taken from the UCIMachine Learning Repository (http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html), but some changes are made for this assignment. The original data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. There are four numeric attributes: sepal length in cm, sepal width in cm, petal length in cm, and petal width in cm. More detailed information can be seen in the file iris.names.

## Requirements
Your program should classify each instance in the test set iris-test.txt according to the training set iris-training.txt.

## Prerequisite;
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Please keep all the related data files in the same folder (i.e.part1).

## Running Steps:
1. Open Terminal console
2. Go to the project part1 directory
3. Run command: python KNN.py iris-training.txt iris-test.txt
4. An output file (sampleoutput.txt) will be generated in the same project folder. Check it for the result.
